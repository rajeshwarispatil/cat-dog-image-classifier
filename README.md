# cat-dog-image-classifier

A Python-based machine learning project that uses a **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** classifier to distinguish between images of cats and dogs.  
This project was developed independently to practice image preprocessing and classical machine learning techniques.

---

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to classify images into two categories:
- Cat
- Dog

The project demonstrates the complete workflow of an image classification task using traditional ML methods rather than deep learning.

---

## Features
- Load and preprocess cat and dog images
- Resize images to a uniform size
- Convert images to grayscale
- Extract features suitable for SVM
- Train/test split using scikit-learn
- SVM model training and evaluation
- Save trained model for later use

---

## Tech Stack
- Python
- scikit-learn
- NumPy
- OpenCV / PIL (whichever you used)
- Matplotlib (optional, for visualization)
